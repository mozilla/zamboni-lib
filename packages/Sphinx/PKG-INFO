Description: 
        Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
        documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of
        multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl.
        It was originally created to translate the new Python documentation,
        but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be useful to many
        other projects.
        
        Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths
        come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its
        parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.
        
        Although it is still under constant development, the following features
        are already present, work fine and can be seen "in action" in the Python docs:
        
        * Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), plain text and LaTeX,
        for printable PDF versions
        * Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links
        for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
        * Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
        links to siblings, parents and children
        * Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
        * Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
        * Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
        and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings.
